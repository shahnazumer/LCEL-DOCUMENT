    "LangGraph is a library built on top of LangChain, designed to add cyclic computational capabilities to your LLM applications.  Langraph introduces the ability to add cycles, enabling more complex, agent-like behaviors where you can call an LLM in a loop, asking it what action to take next. LangGraph is a versatile tool for building complex, stateful applications with LLMs. By understanding its core concepts and working through simple examples, beginners can start to leverage its power for their projects."

    "- ***Stateful Graph:*** where each node in the graph represents a step in your computation, and the graph maintains a state that is passed around and updated as the computation progresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Nodes***:Nodes are the building blocks of your LangGraph. Each node represents a function or a computation step. You define nodes to perform specific tasks, such as processing input, making decisions, or interacting with external APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Edges***: Edges connect the nodes in your graph, defining the flow of computation. LangGraph supports conditional edges, allowing you to dynamically determine the next node to execute based on the current state of the graph."
