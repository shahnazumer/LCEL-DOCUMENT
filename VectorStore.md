# Concepts

This guide delves into the inner workings of LangChain, providing a clear understanding of its core components. We'll embark on a journey through vector stores 

# Vector Store
Vector stores, fundamentally, are specialized databases designed to efficiently store and manage vectors, which are high-dimensional arrays of numbers. These vectors are not arbitrary; they are the product of sophisticated text embedding models, such as those provided by OpenAI's text-embedding API.The document discusses different vector stores including;
1. Chroma, 
2. FAISS, 
3. LanceDB,
4. Pinecone,
5. Qdrant etc.
 Each can be used to store and search over unstructured data

In the context of our application, vector stores play a pivotal role in enhancing the capabilities of our language model. Here's a deeper dive into the process:

1. Vector Generation: Whenever new content related to LangChain is introduced or existing content is updated, we use text embedding models to convert this textual information into vectors. Each vector acts as a unique fingerprint of its corresponding text, encapsulating its meaning in a high-dimensional space.

2. Similarity Searches: The core utility of storing these vectors comes into play when we need to find information relevant to a user's query. By converting the user's question into a vector using the same embedding model, we can perform a similarity search across our vector store. This search identifies vectors (and thus, documents) whose meanings are closest to the query, based on the distance between vectors in the embedding space.

3. Context Retrieval and Enhancement: The documents retrieved through similarity searches are relevant pieces of information that aid the language model in generating relevant answers. By providing this context, we enable the language model to generate responses that are not only accurate but also informed by the most relevant and up-to-date information available in our database.
